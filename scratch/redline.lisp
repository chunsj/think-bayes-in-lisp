;; THE MODEL
;;
;; passenger arrivals as a poisson process, which means that passengers are equally likely to arrive
;; at any time, and that they arrive at an unknown rate, Î», measured in passengers per minute, and is
;; assumed as a constant.
;;
;; the arrival process for trains is not poisson. trains are supposed to leave from the end of line
;; every 7~8 minutes during peak time, but by the time they get to current station, the time between
;; trains varies between 3 and 12 minutes.

;; if you stood on the platform from 4pm to 6pm and recorded the time between trains, this is the
;; distribution you would see.

;; but if you arrive at some random time (without regard to the train schedule) you would see a
;; different distribution. the average time between trains, as seen by a random passenger, is
;; substantially higher than the true average.
;;
;; why? because a passenger is more likely to arrive during a large interval than a small one.
;; consider a simple example: suppose that the time between trains is either 5 minutes or 10 minutes
;; with equal probability. in that case the average time between trains is 7.5 minutes.
;;
;; but a passenger is more likely to arrive during a 10 minute gap than a 5 minute gap; in fact,
;; twice as likely. if we surveyed arriving passengers, we would find that 2/3 of them arrived
;; during a 10 minute gap, and only 1/3 during a 5 minute gap. so the average time between trains,
;; as seen by an arriving passengers, is 8.33 minutes.
;;
;; this kind of observer bias appears in many contexts. strudents think that classes are bigger than
;; they are because more of them are in the big classes. airline passengers think that plains are
;; fuller than they are because more of them are on full flights.
;;
;; in each case, values from the actual distribution are oversampled in proportion to their value.
;; in the red line example, a gap that is twice as big is twice as likely to be observed.
